# Rijks Search

This project was created as part of an assignment to create a search tool using the rijksmuseum API.

## Before you start

### Rijksstudio API Key
You will need an API key to use the APIs. Create an API Key in the [rijksstudio](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio).

### Setup .env file
Create a local `.env` file to store your recently created API Key like below:
```
REACT_APP_SEARCH_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_API_KEY
```

## Running the application

To run the application, you just need to execute `npm start` in your terminal.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Disclosure

This application was not created for production, hence the API Key being used on client side.
